The goal was to segment the customers in order to define a marketing strategy. Unfortunately the colors of the plots change when this kernel is rerun - but here are some thoughts:

Big Spenders with large Payments - they make expensive purchases and have a credit limit that is between average and high. This is only a small group of customers.
Cash Advances with large Payments - this group takes the most cash advances. They make large payments, but this appears to be a small group of customers.
Medium Spenders with third highest Payments - the second highest Purchases group (after the Big Spenders).
Highest Credit Limit but Frugal - this group doesn't make a lot of purchases. It looks like the 3rd largest group of customers.
Cash Advances with Small Payments - this group likes taking cash advances, but make only small payments.
Small Spenders and Low Credit Limit - they have the smallest Balances after the Smallest Spenders, their Credit Limit is in the bottom 3 groups, the second largest group of customers.
Smallest Spenders and Lowest Credit Limit - this is the group with the lowest credit limit but they don't appear to buy much. Unfortunately this appears to be the largest group of customers.
Highest Min Payments - this group has the highest minimum payments (which presumably refers to "Min Payment Due" on the monthly statement. This might be a reflection of the fact that they have the second lowest Credit Limit of the groups, so it looks like the bank has identified them as higher risk.)
So a marketing strategy that targeted the groups might be effective.
